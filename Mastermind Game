Rules of the game
Two players play the game against each other; letâ€™s assume Player 1 and Player 2.

Player 1 plays first by setting a multi-digit number.
Player 2 now tries his first attempt at guessing the number.
If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then Player 1 hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player 2 got correct.
The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.
Now, Player 2 gets to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.
If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned Mastermind.
If not, then Player 2 wins the game.
The real game, however, has proved aesthetics since the numbers are represented by color-coded buttons.

import random

num = random.randrange(1000, 10000)
n = int(input("Guess the 4-digit number:"))

if n == num:
    print("Great! You guessed the number in just 1 try! You're a Mastermind!")
else:
    ctr = 0

    while n != num:
        ctr += 1
        count = 0

        n_str = str(n)
        num_str = str(num)

        for i in range(4):
            if n_str[i] == num_str[i]:
                count += 1

        if count > 0:
            print(f"Not quite the number. But you got {count} digit(s) correct!")
        else:
            print("None of the numbers in your input match.")

        n = int(input("Enter your next guess: "))

    ctr += 1
    print(f"You've become a Mastermind! It took you {ctr} tries.")
